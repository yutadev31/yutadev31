# About Me

👋 Hi, I'm Yuta, a 13-year-old from Japan.

I’m passionate about programming, especially with **Rust**, **Python**, and **web technologies**.

🎮 I also enjoy playing **Minecraft**.

🖥️ I used to use **VSCode**, but I'm in the process of switching to **Neovim** for coding.

🐧 For my development environment, I use **Arch Linux**, which gives me full control over my system and a clean, minimal setup.
